#
# For each person on this list:
# 1. Find the next class they are taking.
# 2. Find the location of that class.
# 3. Find the way to get from your classroom to the personâ€™s next class.
# 4. Tell the person how to get to their next class.

# will be implemented by the concrete, child classes undergrad_student
